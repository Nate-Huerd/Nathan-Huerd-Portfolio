Horiseon Website Refactor Project
What the project does:
The goal of this project was to refactor the Horiseon website. The changes made were done so to make the code more accessbile and efficient. The other goal was to improve the SEO of the website. 

Why the project is useful:
This is a valuable project because, as the intial request of the challenge stated, refactoring code is something that many developers will do when starting in their position, and throughout their career as new technology is created and different ways to write code are developed. Keeping code up-to-date as often as possible also makes refactoring each time that much simpler.

How users can get started with the project:
Take a look at the website and the underlying code. I have added notes where changes were made from the intial code and identified the main sections of the website.
